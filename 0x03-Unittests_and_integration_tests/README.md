# 0x03. Unittests and Integration Tests

## Project Overview

This project focuses on writing **unit tests** and **integration tests** for Python code, particularly functions and classes involved in HTTP calls and data processing. The goal is to build a solid understanding of testing practices such as **mocking**, **parameterization**, **fixtures**, and **memoization**.

- **Weight**: 1
- **Start Date**: May 14, 2025, 6:00 PM
- **End Date**: May 19, 2025, 6:00 PM
- **Checker Release**: May 16, 2025, 12:00 AM
- **Auto Review**: Will launch at deadline

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you will be able to:

- Differentiate between **unit** and **integration tests**
- Apply common testing techniques such as:
  - Mocking
  - Parametrizations
  - Fixtures
- Properly document and structure your Python test files
- Use `unittest` and `mock` libraries effectively

## Concepts

- **Unit Testing**: Focuses on individual functions. Assumes external dependencies work correctly. External function calls should be **mocked**.
- **Integration Testing**: Tests full execution paths and the interaction between different parts of the codebase. Only **low-level I/O calls** (e.g., HTTP, DB) should be mocked.

## Requirements

- Ubuntu 18.04 LTS
- Python 3.7
- All code should:
  - Follow `pycodestyle` (v2.5)
  - Include executable permissions
  - Begin with `#!/usr/bin/env python3`
  - Include full **module**, **class**, and **function** documentation
  - Include type annotations
  - End with a newline

## Execute Tests

```bash
$ python -m unittest path/to/test_file.py
